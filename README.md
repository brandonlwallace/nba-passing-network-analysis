# Using Network Science to Investigate NBA Success and Passing

The practical question motivating this project is: does increased collaboration improve performance? Complex tasks in private business and public services are typically assigned to teams composed of individuals, where complimentary skills and expertise can augment individual contributions. This project derives insight from professional basketball where different teams develop their own strategies for team-based success at high stakes. Passing the ball is a collaborative act between teammates for the purpose of scoring. The more passes exchanged between teammates, the higher the degree of collaboration on a single possession.

This project utilizes the nba_api and techniques from network science, computational social science, and statistics.
